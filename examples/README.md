# ELOT Examples — Round-Trip Testing

This directory contains a **round-trip test suite** for
[ELOT](https://github.com/johanwk/elot).  The tests exercise the full
ELOT pipeline on a collection of real-world ontologies, checking
whether an ontology survives the journey from OWL through ELOT's Org
format and back again.

## Motivation

ELOT lets you author OWL ontologies in Emacs Org mode.  A key part of
the workflow is *importing* an existing OWL ontology into Org (via
`elot-exporter`) and *exporting* it back to OWL (via `elot-tangle`).
Ideally this round-trip would be lossless — the output ontology would
be logically identical to the input.  In practice, some information
may be lost or transformed:

- **Annotation patterns** that ELOT does not yet represent may be
  dropped or simplified during export to Org.
- **Axiom structures** such as complex class expressions, property
  chains, or GCIs may not survive the Org representation faithfully.
- **Serialisation differences** (blank node IDs, ordering, syntactic
  sugar) can produce superficial diffs even when the ontology is
  logically equivalent.

Running these tests regularly serves two purposes:

1. **Bug detection.**  A regression that silently drops axioms shows
   up as new diff lines in the report.
2. **Documenting limitations.**  The diffs that persist across runs
   make explicit what ELOT cannot (yet) represent.  This sets clear
   expectations for users who import third-party ontologies.

## How It Works

The pipeline has seven steps, orchestrated by `make`:

```

### Step 1 — Fetch Sources

Ontologies are listed in `ontology-list.tsv` (tab-separated: `id`,
`source_type`, `source_uri`).  Remote ontologies (`url` type) are
downloaded with `curl`; local ones (`local` type) are used in place.

### Step 2 — Baseline OMN

Each source is converted to OWL Manchester Syntax (`.omn`) using
[ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/).  This normalised OMN serves as
the reference for the diff — it removes serialisation variation from
the comparison.

### Step 3 — Export to Org

The ELOT exporter (`elot-exporter.jar`) reads the source OWL file and
writes an ELOT-format Org file.  This is the "import" half of the
round-trip.

### Step 4 — Tangle to OMN

Two tangling implementations run on the same Org files:

- **Step 4a (Elisp):** Emacs runs in batch mode, loads `elot-mode`,
  visits the generated Org file, and tangles it to OMN via
  `elot-tangle-buffer-to-omn`.  Output: `output/<id>.omn`.

- **Step 4b (elot-cli):** The TypeScript CLI (`tools/elot-cli`) parses
  the same Org file via orgize WASM and generates OMN.  Output:
  `output-cli/<id>.omn`.

### Step 5 — Diff

ROBOT's `diff` command compares the baseline OMN (step 2) against the
round-tripped OMN (step 4a).  Both a plain-text diff and an HTML
report are produced for each ontology.

### Step 5b — Compare Elisp vs CLI

A plain `diff -u` between `output/<id>.omn` and `output-cli/<id>.omn`
catches divergences between the two implementations.  Results go to
`reports/elisp-vs-cli/<id>.diff`.

### Step 6 — JSON Report

A small JSON file per ontology records metadata (source URI,
timestamp, ELOT version) alongside the diff outcome (status and number
of diff lines).

### Step 7 — Summary Report

The script `generate-roundtrip-report.sh` reads all JSON reports and
produces `roundtrip-report.md` — a Markdown table showing each
ontology's round-trip status at a glance.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Prerequisites: java, emacs, curl, and ROBOT on PATH (or configured below).

# Run the full pipeline:
make

# Run in parallel (recommended for many ontologies):
make -j4

# Process a single ontology end-to-end:
make pizza.roundtrip

# Compare Elisp vs CLI for a single ontology:
make pizza.compare

# Tangle all ontologies with elot-cli:
make roundtrip-cli

# Compare all: Elisp vs CLI output:
make compare

# Download sources only:
make fetch-sources

# See all available targets:
make help
```

### Configuration

Override tool paths via environment variables or on the `make`
command line:

| Variable             | Default                          | Description                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ELOT_EXPORTER_JAR`  | `java -jar ~/bin/elot-exporter.jar` | ELOT exporter command             |
| `ROBOT`              | `java -jar ~/bin/robot.jar`      | ROBOT command                        |
| `EMACS`              | `emacs`                          | Emacs binary                         |
| `ELOT_PACKAGE_DIR`   | `../elot-package`                | Path to elot-package elisp directory |
| `ELOT_CLI_DIR`       | `../tools/elot-cli`              | Path to elot-cli TypeScript project  |
| `ELOT_CLI`           | (derived from ELOT_CLI_DIR)      | Full elot-cli invocation command     |

## Adding a New Ontology

Append a line to `ontology-list.tsv`:

```tsv
my-ontology	url	https://example.com/my-ontology.owl
```

Or for a local file already in `sources/`:

```tsv
my-ontology	local	sources/my-ontology.omn
```

Then run `make my-ontology.roundtrip` to test it, or just `make` for
the full suite.

## Interpreting Results

The summary in `roundtrip-report.md` shows:

- **✅ identical** — the round-trip preserved all axioms.  The
  ontology is fully representable in ELOT's Org format.
- **⚠️ differences** — some axioms differ.  Inspect the diff
  (`reports/<id>.diff`) or the HTML report (`reports/<id>.diff.html`)
  to understand what was lost or changed.
- **❌ error** — a pipeline step failed (download, conversion,
  tangle, or diff).

A persistent diff is not necessarily a bug — it may reflect a known
limitation of ELOT's Org representation.  Diffs that *appear* after a
code change, however, likely indicate a regression.

## Cleanup

```sh
make clean       # Remove derived files (org/, output/, reports/), keep downloads
make distclean   # Also remove downloaded sources (local files are kept)
```
