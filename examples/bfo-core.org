* About this file
This ELOT example was created by from the BFO-2020 ontology release of
2024-01-29, file /bfo-core.ttl/, downloaded from
https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/releases/tag/release-2024-01-29.
The file was opened with the ELOT function ~elot-open-owl~.

One change was made to the source file before converting to an
org-mode document: The empty prefix ~:~ was applied to shorten
identifiers (for instance, from
~<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000030>~ for the class 'object' to
just ~:BFO_0000030~).

In the ~:PROPERTIES:~ org-mode "drawer" below, below the top headline,
some important changes have been made after conversion.
 - the ~:tangle~ target was changed to ~bfo-core.omn~. By default, ELOT
   will use the /localname/ of an ontology to determine the filename of
   an output ontology file. Because the localname of BFO-2020 is
   ~bfo.owl~, this will produce ~bfo.owl.omn~ (Manchester Syntax) and
   ~bfo.owl.ttl~ (Turtle), which is not intuitive!
 - The ~:ELOT-default-prefix:~ has been made blank, since this ontology
   uses a blank prefix (the colon ~:~). This is important for using the
   "F4" menu shorthand for inserting classes and properties.
