** Cell Ontology

CL-basic from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cl/cl-basic.owl.
This is part of the Cell Ontology, see https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/cl and http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cl.owl.

** Units of Measure
[[./om-2.org][om-2.org]]: 840kB

Ontology of Units of Measure from http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/page/om-2

** UBERON

Uberon Multi-species Anatomy Ontology from https://obophenotype.github.io/uberon/ and http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon.owl.

Warning: 
- The file is very large. ~elot~ startup code has been removed from that file to speed up loading.
- But still, Emacs may hang for a very long time before responding (eg 10 minutes). So it's perhaps better to use ~find-file-literally~ to avoid that.

** CIM Equipment
[[61970-600-2_Equipment-AP-Voc-RDFS2020_v3-0-0.org][61970-600-2_Equipment-AP-Voc-RDFS2020_v3-0-0.org]]: 305kB

Electrical CIM: equipment ontology from [[https://github.com/Sveino/Inst4CIM-KG/blob/develop/rdfs-improved/CGMES/ttl/61970-600-2_Equipment-AP-Voc-RDFS2020_v3-0-0.ttl][61970-600-2_Equipment-AP-Voc-RDFS2020_v3-0-0.ttl]]
** BFO-2020
[[file:bfo-core.org][bfo-core.org]]

Basic Formal Ontology (BFO-2020) from https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/releases/tag/release-2024-01-29.
An "About" section has been added after conversion.

** Plant Ontology
[[file:plant-ontology.obo.org][plant-ontology.obo.org]]: 1.8M

Plant Ontology from https://github.com/Planteome/plant-ontology/releases

* Other examples
These examples were made before the ~elot-exporter~ was available. They
will eventually be updated, once the exporter is more complete.

** Maintenance
[[file:maintenance.org][maintenance.org]]

This is the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) Maintenance ontology, from https://spec.industrialontologies.org/iof/ontology/maintenance/Maintenance/.

This example is noteworthy for showing how ELOT's /label display/ feature simplifies working with non-informative resource identifiers from BFO. 
E.g. a subclass axiom like the following, from the class /failure effect/ ([[https://spec.industrialontologies.org/iof/ontology/maintenance/Maintenance/FailureEffect][iof-maint:FailureEffect]]), appears in the buffer as the list entry
#+begin_quote
  - SubClassOf :: /preceded by/ some (/failure event/ or /failure process/)
#+end_quote
which is much better than
#+begin_quote
   - SubClassOf :: obo:BFO_0000062 some (iof-maint:FailureEvent or iof-maint:FailureProcess)
#+end_quote
** Pizza
[[file:pizza.org][pizza.org]]

This is the famous Pizza ontology used in well-known tutorials.

This example is useful for containing sections with ROBOT metrics,
SPARQL queries, and an /rdfpuml/ diagram.
